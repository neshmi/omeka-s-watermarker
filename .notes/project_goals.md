# Project Goals

## Overview
Watermarker is an Omeka S module designed to manage and apply watermarks to images within the Omeka S digital collection management system. The module allows administrators to create multiple watermark sets, define specific watermark images for each set, and apply these watermarks to various resource types including individual images and image sets.

## Key Objectives
- Create a user-friendly interface for managing watermark sets within Omeka S
- Allow flexible configuration of multiple watermark images with different properties
- Implement settings to control which resources receive watermarks
- Ensure watermarks are appropriately applied to derivative images
- Maintain the original image quality while adding visible watermarks
- Preserve performance by optimizing the watermarking process

## Target Users
- Museum digital collection managers
- Library and archive administrators
- Academic institutions managing digital repositories
- Cultural heritage organizations preserving digital assets

## Success Metrics
- Successful application of watermarks to images without degrading image quality
- Intuitive UI for managing watermark settings
- Minimal performance impact on image loading and processing
- Positive feedback from Omeka S community

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Basic module structure and admin interface for watermark sets
- Phase 2: Watermark image management and configuration options
- Phase 3: Resource-specific settings and integration with Omeka S media rendering
- Final Release: Testing, documentation, and public release
