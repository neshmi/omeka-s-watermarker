# Workflows

## Development Process
The Watermarker module follows these development workflows:

### Feature Development
1. Create a new branch from `develop` named `feature/feature-name`
2. Implement feature with necessary tests
3. Run test suite locally to ensure all tests pass
4. Create a pull request to merge into `develop`
5. After review and approval, merge into `develop`

### Bug Fixes
1. Create a branch from `develop` named `fix/bug-description`
2. Implement fix with test case to prevent regression
3. Run test suite locally
4. Create a pull request to merge into `develop`
5. For critical fixes, also create PR to `master` after `develop` merge

### Release Process
1. Create a release branch from `develop` named `release/vX.Y.Z`
2. Finalize documentation and version numbers
3. Run full test suite
4. Merge into `master` and tag with version number
5. Merge release changes back to `develop`

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual components and services
- Integration tests for controller actions
- End-to-end tests for watermarking process
- Manual testing on sample Omeka S installation

## Code Review Guidelines
- Ensure all code follows conventions
- Verify feature completeness against requirements
- Check for security concerns, especially with file uploads
- Validate performance considerations
- Confirm proper error handling

## Documentation Requirements
- README.md with installation and basic usage instructions
- Code documentation with PHPDoc
- User documentation in the Omeka S admin interface
- Example configurations and use cases

## Continuous Integration
- Automated tests run on pull requests
- Static code analysis for quality checks
- Compatibility testing with different Omeka S versions

## Deployment
- Package module as zip file for Omeka S module directory
- Include all necessary dependencies
- Provide upgrade scripts for version changes
- Include data migration tools if schema changes

## Maintenance
- Monitor Omeka S version compatibility
- Address community feedback and bug reports
- Regular security updates
- Performance optimization as needed
