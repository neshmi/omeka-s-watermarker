# Architecture

## Module Structure
The Watermarker module follows the standard Omeka S module architecture with these key components:

### Controllers
- `WatermarkSetsController`: Manages CRUD operations for watermark sets
- `WatermarkImagesController`: Handles watermark image uploads and configurations
- `SettingsController`: Controls global module settings and resource-specific configurations

### Models
- `WatermarkSet`: Represents a collection of related watermark images
- `WatermarkImage`: Represents a single watermark image with its properties
- `ResourceSetting`: Maps watermark settings to specific resource types

### Services
- `WatermarkManager`: Core service for applying watermarks to images
- `MediaRenderer`: Extends Omeka S media rendering to include watermarks
- `ConfigurationManager`: Handles module configuration and settings persistence

### Views
- Admin interface for managing watermark sets
- Configuration forms for watermark properties
- Integration with resource browse/edit views for watermark settings

## Data Flow
1. Admin creates watermark sets and uploads watermark images
2. Admin configures which resource types use which watermark sets
3. When resources are viewed, the appropriate watermark is retrieved
4. Watermark is applied to the requested derivative image
5. Watermarked image is served to the user

## Integration Points
- Hooks into Omeka S media renderer
- Extends resource forms to include watermark settings
- Utilizes Omeka S permission system for access control
- Uses Omeka S event system for module configuration and watermarking process

## Dependencies
- Omeka S core (minimum version: 3.0)
- GD or ImageMagick for image processing
- Proper file permissions for derivative image creation

## Performance Considerations
- Watermarks are applied to derivatives, not original files
- Caching system for watermarked derivatives to prevent repeated processing
- Batch processing option for applying watermarks to existing collections
